 The goal was trying out some new ways of using the conditional statements without using the same examples that can be found in almost all the beginner tutorials. In the beginning, the examples would confuse me because I didn't understand how they would connect together.
 
  Understanding and experimenting with what I've learned shows me the output of the progress from all the time and hours spent into learning the fundamentals. Still a long way to go.
  
   Creating a simple background helps me to stay creative for front end purposes. My preference is CSS, HTML, and Javascript from scratch, because of learning.
